First, log into your GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one for free at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). This will enable you to take part in the editing of la-chicharra.org.

Once you are logged in, click the 'New Species' button and fill out the entry data to name a new species and add your personal story. If you click the button while on one of the species page you will be directed to edit and add more information to that species.

If you want to add your artwork to the site, click on the “Add Artwork” button. If you click it from the homepage you will be asked to choose what species you want to illustrate and if you click the button from the species page you will automatically be assigned that species to create a representation of.
